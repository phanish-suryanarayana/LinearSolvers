# LinearSolvers

Collection of solvers for linear systems of equations for both serial and parallel computations. 

Currently, you can find the Alternating Anderson Richardson (AAR) method \[1,2\] implemented in Matlab, PETSc, and standalone C w/ MPI code. Additional details can be found in the README file with each subfolder. Users of the code are expected to cite one of the references below, preferably \[1\].
